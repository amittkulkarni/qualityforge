## Architecture

Quality Forge uses a **three-agent, CrewAI** architecture:

| Agent        | Role                                 | Key Tools                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Reviewer** | Detects complexity, dead code, naming issues | `ast_parser`, `pylint_runner` |
| **Refactorer** | Generates patches to fix issues     | `apply_patch`                          |
| **Git Ops**  | Creates branch, commits, pushes, opens PR | `git_tool`                             |
